## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
<strong>Do not</strong> want to work for a startup. Feel slightly less strong about working for a small to medium sized business

I'd love to do product work for a LARGE corporation/company. I want stability & to work on a team with more senior people / CLEAR DEFINED ROLES. Am open to agency work (duh I want a job), but would prefer a large company for product work.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I would prefer a role primarly focused in the backend - ideally on the product side. I have a background in both direct/indirect sales and project management so I'd be happy in a client-facing role as well (I can literally talk to a brick wall for an hour).
